# Local Development (Ubuntu 25.10)

Fennec Migrate uses a containerized Go toolchain for reliable local testing. You do not need host Go installed.

## Install Docker Engine
Run the setup script using sudo:

```bash
sudo ./tools/dev/setup-ubuntu-25.10-docker.sh
```

## Verify your environment
Run the doctor script:

```bash
./tools/dev/doctor.sh
```

## Run tests

```bash
make test
```

## Common problems
- Docker permission denied: run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` then `newgrp docker`.
- Docker Compose missing: rerun `sudo ./tools/dev/setup-ubuntu-25.10-docker.sh`.

## Notes
- If Docker requires sudo, use `sudo docker ...` (and `sudo make test`) until group membership is configured.
- Rootless Docker is an alternative for development: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/
